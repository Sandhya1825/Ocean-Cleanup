# Ocean-Cleanup-Analysis

Insights derived:
This dataset deals on the initiative that is taken by USA where in the ocean is set to clean. I was really surprised by the stats by which how amount we have been polluting our oceans. Huge amount of volunteers (723K) have participated in this clean up with Adults being a major part of 630K and children were 93K. They formed into 10K different groups and had taken the initiative to clean the ocean. Most people are from coastal States of USA.

The cleanup started in 1980s -90s itself, but the awareness was less. However, the good thought of cleaning up the ocean with different debris took rise in early 2000s and the high amount of it was encouraged and done between 2015 - 2020 (being the highest). Also, larger amounts were segragated out in the months of Sep - Nov.

Top 5 Categories causing the utmost pollution were:

* Plastic - 8309K
* Foam - 3884 K
* Cigars - 3605 K
* Metal - 990K
* Glass - 919K
were collected.

Top 5 Items that were collected were Cigar Butts (3316 K) , Plastic Pieces (2993 K), Food Wrappers (1255 K), Glass pieces (543 K), Toys (50 K).

The clean up of the ocean was done through three different types -
Land (Beach, Shore- line & Inland) - 18796 K,
Watercraft - 233 K,
Underwater - 22 K of debris was collected.

Top 5 countries collected the highest amount of trash - California, Florida, Massachussets, Connecticut, New York.

Hopefully, we need to decrease polluting our oceans & preserve our nature.
